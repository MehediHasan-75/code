            weight
here child class can access l, w, h , weight but base class cant access weight
@this child class is inheriting propertise from base class

class Child extends Base{
int weight;
}
@ extends keyword means Child calss will have the property of Base Class and also has some additional properties that base class dosent has
Child child=new Child();
child.l;
child.w;
child.h;

// parent can not access child property
Box box5 =new BoxWeight(2, 3, 4, 8);
here Box is referencing the object BoxWeight. we can,t access weight as 
the element on reference veriable can only accessible.

//there are many veriabls in both parent and child classes. you are only given access to veriables that are in the reference type.
 BoxWeight box6= new Box(2, 3, 4);
 // this will give an error because we can access the weight veriable as the reference is children type
 //but the object itself it parent type . so how can we call constructor to initialize extra veriabls on children type class?
 
 #types of ingeritace :
 1-->single inheritace: extends another class
    _____
    |Box|
       |
      \/
    |BoxWeight|
2--> multilevel inheritace:One children is parent for another
   Box--> BoxWeight-->BoxPrice
3--> multiple ingeritace: one class is extending more than one classes
     if two or more parent classes have same veriable(property) then there will create a ambiguaty
     hence java dosenot support multiple inheritance 
    //here for this work java introduce interfaces
4-->Hierarcial inheritace: One class is inheritad by many classes
            |A|

     B       C    D   E 
5-->Hybride: single + multiple inheritace

# a class cant be its own super class 
public class B extends B{
    //not allowed.
}
