#Encapsulation: Encapsulation is about grouping data and methods together within a class, controlling access to the internal state of objects, and ensuring data integrity and code maintainability.
Abstraction is about providing a simplified and generalized view of objects, hiding unnecessary details, and focusing on the essential behavior and interfaces. It promotes code reuse, modularity, and flexibility in software design.


#Abstraction: Hiding the unnecessary details and showing valuable information.
Example: System.out.Prinrln("hi"); we just wanted to print hi.How this thing is happing internally I don't care.
this is an designing issue.
